HIGH PRIORITY
	- Collector 1000000000% working - Logan
	- Check out drive encoders - Tristan
	- OI code - Matthew
	- Work on climber - Calvin


NOT AS HIGH PRIORITY: 
	- Shooter:
		- Vertical/Horizontal Activation
		- Shooter wheel spin up etc.
		- Ball injector
		- Add control into main
	- Bug Fixes - EVERYONE
	- Logger & Diagnostics - Jacob
	- Autonomous* - Tristan/Matthew DUE FEB 13
	- Vision - Nick DUE FEB 18
	- Laptop configuration - Adrian
		-ssh config:
			-Fix the "rm ~/.ssh/known_hosts" problem
			-add "StrictHostKeyChecking no/UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null" for robot


NICE THINGS TO HAVE:
	- Update c++ compiler to use c++14 for tests in runall2
	- IMU - Calvin
	- Clean-up stuff:
		- Use enum class more places
		- Use std::array in place of C arrays in several places
	- Meta IO information
		- Add a function that will discover which IOs different parts use (and make a nice list)
		- Make a data type to talk about different inputs


*AUTO-MODE REQUIREMENTS & STEPS:
	Assuming we're starting with the ball in the robot~
	1. Go through defense (ask Tristan Briggler which defense it will be, but the goal is to have an autonomous mode for each defense, selected via the OI.)
	2. Drive to low goal 
	3. Position robot to score
	4. Score low goal with ball
	5. Reposition to return to defenses
	6. Return to defenses
	7. Go back through defense to the center (also could go through low bar?)
	8. Position for begining of TELE-OP (lower collector)
