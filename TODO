HIGH PRIORITY:
	- Bug fixes - Everyone
	- Change drivebase IOs if needed - Logan
	- Change manipulators - Logan
	- OI code - Matthew
		

NOT AS HIGH PRIORITY:
	- Logger & Diagnostics
	- Autonomous - Tristan
	- Vision - Nick
	- Laptop configuration - Adrian
		-ssh config:
			-Fix the "rm ~/.ssh/known_hosts" problem

NICE THINGS TO HAVE:
	- Chee-Z parts - Nick
	- Clean-up stuff:
		- Use enum class more places
		- Use std::array in place of C arrays in several places
	- Meta IO information
		-Add a function that will discover which IOs different parts use (and make a nice list)
		-Make a data type to talk about different inputs
