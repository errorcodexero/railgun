HIGH PRIORITY:
	- Bug fixes
	- Change drivebase type
	- Change manipulators
	

NOT AS HIGH PRIORITY:
	- Autonomous
	- Laptop configuration
		-ssh config:
			-Fix the "rm ~/.ssh/known_hosts" problem
			-add "StrictHostKeyChecking no/UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null" for robot
	
		
NICE THINGS TO HAVE:
	-Clean-up stuff:
		-use enum class more places
		-use std::array in place of C arrays in several places
	-Meta IO information
		-Add a function that will discover which IOs different parts use (and make a nice list)
		-Make a data type to talk about different inputs
