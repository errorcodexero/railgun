6-Hour Window:
	- Connectivity test (check for issue we are/were having with the practice bot - NOT WORKING)
	

HIGH PRIORITY for Auburn:
	- Connectivity test (check for issue we are/were having with the practice bot - NOT WORKING)
	- Autonomous* - Tristan
		- Drive Encoders
		- Testing on carpet field with measurements
		- Complete all modes, ready for testing 
	- Shooter code
	- Logging - Jacob
	- Turn off windows updates on all machines	

LOW PRIORITY for Auburn:
	- Log Analysis - Nick
	- PWM mode outputs for blinky lights (DIO 9)
	- Add auto-shut off for climber with the hall effect sensor	
		

NOT AS HIGH PRIORITY: 
	- Laptop configuration
		-ssh config:
			-Fix the "rm ~/.ssh/known_hosts" problem
			-add "StrictHostKeyChecking no/UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null" for robot

NICE THINGS TO HAVE:
	- Add tests into main.cpp, including autonomous
	- Clean-up stuff:
		- Use enum class more places
		- Use std::array in place of C arrays in several places
	- Update c++ compilers to use c++14 for runall2 tests	
	- Meta IO information
		- Add a function that will discover which IOs different parts use (and make a nice list)
		- Make a data type to talk about different inputs
