6-Hour Window:
	- Connectivity test (check for issue we are/were having with the practice bot - NOT WORKING)
	

HIGH PRIORITY for Auburn:
	- Connectivity test (check for issue we are/were having with the practice bot - NOT WORKING)
	- Autonomous* - Tristan
		- Drive Encoders
		- Testing on carpet field with measurements
		- Complete all modes, ready for testing
	- Fix issues from W-ville
	- Add hall effect climber shutoff 
	- Use currents to prevent fast battery draining
	- Consider changing portcullis to drive collector up before driving robot forward, similar to Cheval but less delay,  OR  consider repurposing it completely as the mode is never used


LOW PRIORITY for Auburn:
	- Logger & Diagnostics
	- PWM mode outputs for blinky lights (DIO 9)	
	
	

NOT AS HIGH PRIORITY: 
	- Laptop configuration
		-ssh config:
			-Fix the "rm ~/.ssh/known_hosts" problem
			-add "StrictHostKeyChecking no/UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null" for robot


NICE THINGS TO HAVE:
	- Add tests into main.cpp, including autonomous
	- Clean-up stuff:
		- Use enum class more places
		- Use std::array in place of C arrays in several places
	- Update c++ compilers to use c++14 for runall2 tests	
	- Meta IO information
		- Add a function that will discover which IOs different parts use (and make a nice list)
		- Make a data type to talk about different inputs
