NICE THINGS TO HAVE:
	- Clean-up stuff:
		- Use enum class more places
		- Use std::array in place of C arrays in several places
	- Meta IO information
		-Add a function that will discover which IOs different parts use (and make a nice list)
		 -Make a data type to talk about different inputs




AUTO-MODE REQUIREMENTS & STEPS:
