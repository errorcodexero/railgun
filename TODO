Wednesday Window:
	- Full system check
		- Driving: forward, backward, turning, boost, and nudges
		- Collector: presets, auto modes, and manual controls
		- Climber: release and winch



HIGH PRIORITY for Worlds:
	- Debug netconsole.py not printing anything sometimes
	- Re-label OI
	- Maybe prevent climber release when collector is at top
	- High goal shooter code
		- Get shoot prep to work (?)
		- Get shooter speed in rpm
		- Get closed loop control working for shooter
	- Autonomous 
		- Sensors
		- Auto_nav_run results in seg fault
		- Drive Encoders
		- Testing on carpet field with measurements
		- Low goal auto mode 
	- Logging


LOW PRIORITY for Worlds:
	- Log Analysis - Nick
	- Add auto-shut off for climber with the hall effect sensor	
		

NOT AS HIGH PRIORITY: 
	- Laptop configuration
		-ssh config:
			-Fix the "rm ~/.ssh/known_hosts" problem
			-add "StrictHostKeyChecking no/UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null" for robot


NICE THINGS TO HAVE:
	- Expand testing in main.cpp
	- PWM outputs for blinky lights (DIO 9)
	- Clean-up stuff:
		- Use enum class more places
		- Use std::array in place of C arrays in several places
	- Update c++ compilers to use c++14 for runall2 tests	
	- Clean up panel interpret
	- Meta IO information
		- Add a function that will discover which IOs different parts use (and make a nice list)
		- Make a data type to talk about different inputs

Eric's random thoughts:
	-I should try to figure out how the learning logic interacts w/ going into auto, etc.
	-Nav stuff should be a little more collected together
	-Sim stuff could benefit from using Monitor
	-Some of the nav types aren't following the naming convention
	-I should try to figure out what the Joy_collector_position logic is doing
	-Why is there a variable 'simtest' in main?
	-Don't do this before Auburn: There shouldn't be seperate "panel output" and driver station output
	-There's a better way to do SLOW_PRINT
	-Probably not this season: Should try to put a little more structure so that autonomous modes are less prone to be spaghetti-like
