6-Hour Window:
	- Connectivity test/debugging
	- Full system check
		- Driving: forward, backward, turning, boost, and nudges
		- Collector: presets, auto modes, and manual controls
		- Climber: release and winch


HIGH PRIORITY for Auburn:
	- Connectivity debugging
	- Re-label OI
	- Autonomous* - Tristan
		- Auto_nav_run results in seg fault
		- Drive Encoders
		- Testing on carpet field with measurements
		- Complete all modes, ready for testing 
	- Shooter code
		- Get shoot prep to work
		- Get shooter speed in rpm
		- Use ready() to determine if it has spun up
	- Logging
	- Turn off windows updates on all machines
		- Red                                                        - Done
		- Gold                                                       - Done
		- Software 2                                                 -
		- Software 1 (shouldn't be used as a driver station laptop)  - 


LOW PRIORITY for Auburn:
	- Log Analysis - Nick
	- PWM mode outputs for blinky lights (DIO 9)
	- Add auto-shut off for climber with the hall effect sensor	
		

NOT AS HIGH PRIORITY: 
	- Laptop configuration
		-ssh config:
			-Fix the "rm ~/.ssh/known_hosts" problem
			-add "StrictHostKeyChecking no/UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null" for robot


NICE THINGS TO HAVE:
	- Expand testing in main.cpp
	- Clean-up stuff:
		- Use enum class more places
		- Use std::array in place of C arrays in several places
	- Update c++ compilers to use c++14 for runall2 tests	
	- Meta IO information
		- Add a function that will discover which IOs different parts use (and make a nice list)
		- Make a data type to talk about different inputs
