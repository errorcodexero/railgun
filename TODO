HIGH PRIORITY
	- Drivebase - Logan DUE JAN 30
	- Write shooter code - Need to wait until shooter is decided upon for completion
	- Add sensor input into collector code to automate modes - Logan/Matthew
	- Write climber, collector, and shooter code into main - Anyone
	- OI code - Matthew/Logan/Adrian DUE JAN 30 
		

NOT AS HIGH PRIORITY:
	- Bug Fixes - EVERYONE
	- Logger & Diagnostics
	- Autonomous* - Tristan/Matthew DUE FEB 13
	- Vision - Nick DUE FEB 18
	- Laptop configuration - Adrian
		-ssh config:
			-Fix the "rm ~/.ssh/known_hosts" problem
			-add "StrictHostKeyChecking no/UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null" for robot


NICE THINGS TO HAVE:
	- IMU - Calvin
	- Clean-up stuff:
		- Use enum class more places
		- Use std::array in place of C arrays in several places
	- Meta IO information
		-Add a function that will discover which IOs different parts use (and make a nice list)
		 -Make a data type to talk about different inputs


*AUTO-MODE REQUIREMENTS & STEPS:
	Starting with ball in bot~
	1. Go through defense (ask Tristan Briggler which defense it will be, but the goal is to have an autonomous mode for each defense, selected via the OI.)
	2. Drive to low goal 
	3. Position robot to score
	4. Score low goal with ball
	5. Reposition to return to defenses
	6. Return to defenses
	7. Go back through defense to the center (also could go through low bar?)
	8. Position for begining of TELE-OP (lower collector)
