AUTO MODE LIST:
	- Define networking API
	- Prove reliable comms from TEGRA <-> ROBORIO
	- Drive detect at various angles
	- Drive to goal from various angles	


HIGH PRIORITY for Worlds:
	- Debug netconsole.py not printing anything sometimes
	- Prevent print out to netconsole when robot is not receiving packets from the driverstation
	- Re-label OI
	- Maybe prevent climber release when collector is at top
	- High goal shooter code
		- Make shooter mode go back to speeding up mode if ready no longer returns true
		- Get shoot prep to work (?)
		- Make OI dial +/- 20% speed
		- Speed learning
		- Consider changing the current assumption that the ball's left after 1.5sec to when the ball sensor isn't seeing it
		- Stop goal cuts power
		- Get printing talon_srx_controls to work
		- Make high goal rpm more consistent (and change pid values to be ones we actually want)
	- Autonomous 
		- Sensors
		- Auto_nav_run results in seg fault
		- Drive Encoders
		- Testing on carpet field with measurements
		- Low goal auto mode 
	- Logging


LOW PRIORITY for Worlds:
	- Log Analysis - Nick
	- Add auto-shut off for climber with the hall effect sensor	
		

NOT AS HIGH PRIORITY: 
	- Laptop configuration
		-ssh config:
			-Fix the "rm ~/.ssh/known_hosts" problem
			-add "StrictHostKeyChecking no/UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null" for robot


NICE THINGS TO HAVE:
	- Expand testing in main.cpp
	- PWM outputs for blinky lights (DIO 9)
	- Clean-up stuff:
		- Use enum class more places
		- Use std::array in place of C arrays in several places
	- Update c++ compilers to use c++14 for runall2 tests	
	- Clean up panel interpret
	- Meta IO information
		- Add a function that will discover which IOs different parts use (and make a nice list)
		- Make a data type to talk about different inputs

Eric's random thoughts:
	-I should try to figure out how the learning logic interacts w/ going into auto, etc.
	-Nav stuff should be a little more collected together
	-Sim stuff could benefit from using Monitor
	-Some of the nav types aren't following the naming convention
	-I should try to figure out what the Joy_collector_position logic is doing
	-Why is there a variable 'simtest' in main?
	-Don't do this before Auburn: There shouldn't be seperate "panel output" and driver station output
	-There's a better way to do SLOW_PRINT
	-Probably not this season: Should try to put a little more structure so that autonomous modes are less prone to be spaghetti-like
