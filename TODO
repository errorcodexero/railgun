HIGH PRIORITY
	- Tilt learn - Logan/Matthew
	- Driver/gunner controls
	- OI code - Matthew
	- Climber - Calvin
	- Autonomous* - Tristan


NOT AS HIGH PRIORITY: 
	- Check out drive encoders
	- Shooter:
		- Vertical/Horizontal Activation
		- Shooter wheel spin up etc.
		- Ball injector
		- Add control into main
	- Logger & Diagnostics - Jacob
	- Vision - Nick 
	- Laptop configuration
		-ssh config:
			-Fix the "rm ~/.ssh/known_hosts" problem
			-add "StrictHostKeyChecking no/UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null" for robot


NICE THINGS TO HAVE:
	- IMU - Calvin
	- Clean-up stuff:
		- Use enum class more places
		- Use std::array in place of C arrays in several places
	- Update c++ compilers to use c++14 for runall2 tests	
	- Meta IO information
		- Add a function that will discover which IOs different parts use (and make a nice list)
		- Make a data type to talk about different inputs


*AUTO-MODE REQUIREMENTS & STEPS:
	Assuming we're starting with the ball in the robot~
	1. Go through defense (ask Tristan Briggler which defense it will be, but the goal is to have an autonomous mode for each defense, selected via the OI.)
	2. Drive to low goal 
	3. Position robot to score
	4. Score low goal with ball
	5. Reposition to return to defenses
	6. Return to defenses
	7. Go back through defense to the center (also could go through low bar?)
	8. Position for begining of TELE-OP (lower collector)
